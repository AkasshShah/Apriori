# Apriori
Using the Apriori algorithm to do basket analysis on a set of transactions.

My goal is to learn the algorithm while exploring different languages and different datastructures.

## ipynb/
This is the Apriori implemented in a Python notebook since a lot (maybe most) of data analysis happens in Python.

## cxx/
This is where the C/C++ implementation will go. It is no secret that C/C++ does run faster and more efficient than Python.
